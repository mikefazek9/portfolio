          <p>
            I am a Self-taught Developer that specializes in Front-End
            Development with a Focus on MERN Stack Technologies. I have the
            assiduous mind set followed along with passion to learn and grow as
            a developer. I am always investing in my time to gain more knowledge
            and understanding in the programming world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time away from code, I love spending time with my wife
            and our dog harley. (maltese-shiz tu mix.) I also enjoy a good round
            of golf and Bass Fishing with my friends. (Fish Fry anyone?) I am
            currently working for a Retail Company and I see the opportunities
            that Tech field can bring me and my family as I strive towards my
            goal.
